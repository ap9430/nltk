Using a dataset of messages from a Facebook group, can engagement be measured based on the content of the message.
Original work classified the messages using a bag of words technique to collect features for classification.
This work was to compare the validity of using a considerably smaller feature set by transforming the words in the messages into grammatical categories instead.
The results were found to be similar to the original study, meaning that this transformation of data is possibly viable.
